            <h2>My History</h2>
            <p>I started learning programming in school at age 11, in the language of Visual Basic. 
                From there, I wanted to get in to game development, so I taught myself unity with C#
                and have come to enjoy writing in C# more than VB. However, my horizons have broadened 
                since then, and I will be looking for work in a more general software engineering role 
                when I leave university. In my first semester here, I have learned Java and Bash to an 
                intermediate level, with bash being the biggest challenge I have faced so far due it's 
                nature being so different to what I'm I'm used to.</p>
