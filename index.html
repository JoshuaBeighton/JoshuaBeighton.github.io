        <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
        <p>I am a second year student at the University of St. Andrews, studying for a Masters degree in Computer
        Science. I'm a Christian and a musician, playing the Piano, Guitar, Bass and Drums, and I love working behind 
        a sound desk or a DAW as well. I enjoy spending time with my friends, going on walks and travelling.</p>

        <h3>My Skills</h3>
        <p>I am a developer in Java, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and Python. My first ever programming 
            language (back when I was 14) was Visual Basic, and I have learned C# and Python on my own time along with Unity,
            and spent a year and a half learning Java for university. I have since progressed to learn web development, including
            CSS, HTML, JavaScript at university, and using TypeScript for a personal project on my <a href="https://github.com/JoshuaBeighton">GitHub</a>.</p>

        <h3>My Projects</h3>
        <p>I am currently working on a project called <a href="duoufsdjbfo">Quizzit</a>, which is designed to work as a quiz hosting
        site, with a host displaying answers on a large screen, and multiple players connecting to compete for the best score.</p>
