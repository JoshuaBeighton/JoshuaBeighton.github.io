        <h2>My History</h2>
        <p>I started learning programming in school at age 11, in the language of Visual Basic.
            From there, I wanted to get in to game development, so I taught myself unity with C#
            and have come to enjoy writing in C# more than VB. However, my horizons have broadened
            since then, and I will be looking for work in a more general software engineering role
            when I leave university. In my first year here, I have learned Bash to an
            beginner level, and Java to an Intermediate level.</p>
