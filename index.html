            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p>I am a third year Computer Science Student at the University of St. Andrews in Fife, Scotland.
                I was born in Nottinghamshire, England, and hold UK and Swiss citizenship. I enjoy playing music, 
                travelling and spending time with my family and friends. I am a devoted Christian, and love being
                part of a church community as well as giving my time to the Christian Union in St. Andrews.
