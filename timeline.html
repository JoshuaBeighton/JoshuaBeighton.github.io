                <p>After enjoying camp so much last year, I decided to come back and do it again.
                    I built on relationships I'd already established with staff and campers alike,
                    contributing to an environoment of learning, growth, and support.

                <h4>Jun 24 - Aug 24</h4>
                <p>
                    In the summer between my first and second years of university, I decided to fly to America
                    to work at a summer camp called Kingsley Pines. A co-ed sleepaway camp in Raymond, Maine,
                    Kingsley Pines works with 8-16 year olds to help them develop skills of independence, conflict
                    resolution, kindness and community living. Our goal as staff was to be a supportive community that
                    helped the campers learn these skills, giving them 20 year memories on the way.

                    After finishing my uni exams, I went back home to Nottinghamshire, working as an Exam Invigilator at
                    the same college I attended while working towards my A-Levels.

                    After completing my GCSEs, I moved on to Bilborough College to take my A-Levels. In my time at
                    Bilborough,
                    I was joint head of the Christian Union with some good friends. I came out of Bilborough with the

                <p>
                    As a job in the summer, I worked at Van Elle, a construction company. More specifically, I worked in
                    the strata division, which focused on ground investigation. My role the first year simply involved data
                    entry of values provided by engineers in the field. In my second year, my role shifted to one of a Technical
                    Assistant. The database software we used provided a mobile app so that engineers could input the data directly
                    in the field, however this app required a lot of admin configuration, and as my role the previously centered
                    around this system, I was brought back the following summer to perform this configuration.
